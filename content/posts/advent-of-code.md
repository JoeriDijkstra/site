The advent of code is a yearly advent calender which presents you with small code challenges. As the name suggests, this is on the 1st - 25th of December. If you have any interest of competing please check [this site](https://adventofcode.com/). I will be participating as usual and am going to use C as my weapon of choice. Many of my coworkers have made me out to be insane.

You can follow along with my [Github](https://github.com/JoeriDijkstra/) for my challenge results. Happy coding!
