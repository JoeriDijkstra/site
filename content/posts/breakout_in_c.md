Game development like it is 1980! In this mini series we will build the famous game **breakout** from scratch using the C programming language, and SDL to make sure it is multi-platform. The game is relatively simple but instead of just showing the code I would like to take some time explaining everything since this is also my foray into the C programming language.

Parts:
- [1. Scoping the game]({{< ref "/breakout/part1" >}} "Part 1: Scoping the game")
